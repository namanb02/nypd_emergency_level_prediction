# Predictive Triage for NYC Motor Vehicle Crashes: A Data-Driven Approach to Emergency Response Prioritization

This repository shows how to train a supervised ML model, which will predict the degree of emergency of a crash in case of a collision event.

USAGE:

Cleanup notebook contains code snippets about how to clean the dataset.

Visualize notebook contains code snippets about generating time-series analysis, and geospatial analysis. This will create an HTML file of heatmap using folium, which you can open using web browser.

Model notebook contains code snippets about training and testing ML models: Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. It further shows how to fine tune models by Hyperparameter tuning. You can save the final model using pickle.
